=======

This project was forked from https://github.com/microsoft/kiota-dotnet at commit a39e975f0f8060325bc165de352312ba8c69f0a2. I will be keeping the same license as was there in this commit and have no plans to change that. This fork was made for my own personal use and there will be changes as I see fit, so this is probably not something you want to use.
